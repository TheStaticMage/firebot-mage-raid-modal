# Installation

The script needs to be installed like any other Firebot startup script:

1. From the latest [Release](https://github.com/TheStaticMage/firebot-mage-raid-modal/releases), download `firebot-mage-raid-modal-<version>.js` into your Firebot scripts directory (File &gt; Open Data Folder, then select the "scripts" directory).

2. Enable custom scripts in Firebot (Settings &gt; Scripts).

3. Add the `Firebot-Mage-Raid-Modal-<version>.js` script that you just added as a startup script (Settings &gt; Scripts &gt; Manage Startup Scripts &gt; Add New Script).

4. Restart Firebot.

After installation, it will not be immediately apparent that you have installed the script. However, the following resources will now be available:

- The **Raid Action Modal** effect
- The **$raidModalActionTargetUserDisplayName** variable
- The **$raidModalActionTargetUsername** variable
- The **Raid Modal** UI extension, displayed with you trigger the Raid Action Modal effect

## Requirements

This script requires Firebot 5.65 or later. The script will fail to initialize if you are running an older version of Firebot.
